NEXT
</div>
		<div>
- Sea levels have risen 10-20 cm since 1900. Most non-polar glaciers are retreating, and the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice is continually decreasing in size

</div>
		<div>- 38%, or nearly 1.4 billion acres, of currently used agricultural land has been degraded
</div>
		<div>- By 2002, it was estimated that 75% of the world’s oceanic fisheries were fished at or beyond capacity, and cod, as a species may have been pushed to biological extinction
</div>
		<div>- 54 nations experienced declines in per capita GDP for more than a decade between 1990 and 2001

</div>
		<div>- The richest 20% of the world’s population holds 85% of the global GNP, and the gap between the rich and poor is further widening


</div>
		<div>
BACK</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>THE FUTURE IS IN YOUR HANDS</div>
		<div>



Business as usual</div>
		<div>



Technological Advancement</div>
		<div>



Reduce usage of non-renewables
</div>
		<div>



Shift costs elsewhere
</div>
		<div>



Employ technological & economic fixes
</div>
		<div>



Stable population & industrial output
</div>
		<div>
While there has been progress, including new technologies, new institutions, and a new awareness of environmental problems, humanity has squandered the opportunity to correct our current course over the last 30 years.</div>
		<div>
These are symptoms of a world in overshoot, where we are drawing on the world’s resources faster than they can be restored, and releasing wastes and pollutants faster than the Earth can render them harmless.

</div>
		<div>
We are heading towards global environmental and economic collapse.

</div>
		<div>
But there may still be time to address these problems and their impacts.
</div>
		<div>A globally effected 2 children policy is enacted. Effective birth control technologies are readily available.</div>
		<div>Slower population growth gives rise to an increased industrial output rate, until rising pollution levels curtail it.
</div>
		<div>STABLE POPULATION& INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT</div>
		<div>In 2040, world population reaches and peaks at 7.5 billion people. Due to slow population growth, consumer goods per capita, food per capita, and life expectancy increase.
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>BUSINESS AS USUAL</div>
		<div>By 2040, world population reaches and peaks at 7.5 billion people. Due to slow population growth, consumer goods per capita, food per capita, and life expectancy increase.</div>
		<div>The choice is yours.</div>
		<div>You are humanity’s last hope</div>
		<div>Allow climate change disruption to change everything about our world
OR
Change everything about our economy to avoid that fate
</div>
		<div>START</div>
		<div>The world has been ravaged by continued expansion of economic growth and human advancement. The constant draining of natural resources will soon overwhelm the natural environment.

</div>
		<div>Technological and economic fixes are employed to alleviate pressures of the limits to growth.</div>
		<div>TECHNOLOGICAL& ECONOMIC FIXES</div>
		<div>Policies are implemented to reduce waste products from individuals and corporations.
</div>
		<div>More effective pollution control technologies are employed, as well as protections against soil erosion, and land enhancement, so as to increase yield.</div>
		<div>TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT</div>
		<div> Luckily, here, you can try to save the world again. In real world however, we may not be so lucky.</div>
		<div>TRY AGAIN</div>
		<div>We are all part of humanity’s last hope
</div>
		<div>Because of decades of collective denial, there is now no gradual, incremental option available to us. We all need to be doing more to achieve a sustainable future.</div>
		<div>SHIFT COSTS ELSEWHERE</div>
		<div>Shifting the costs of environmental damage to other areas allows the world to disguise, deny, or confuse the public of the signs of unsustainability.</div>
		<div>This can take the form of shifting costs elsewhere
</div>
		<div>Globally, policies are put in place to reduce usage of non-renewable resources, and resource efficient technology is put in place.</div>
		<div>REDUCE USAGE OF NON-RENEWABLES</div>
		<div>These result in a blooming population and economy
</div>
		<div>But this technology comes too late.
</div>

SCENARIO 1
</div>
		<div>






SCENARIO 2
</div>
		<div>






SCENARIO 1</div>
		<div>






SCENARIO 2</div>
		<div>
SCENARIO 2</div>
		<div>This leads to industrial decline, which then forces declines in the service and agricultural sectors.
</div>
		<div>Natural resources become harder to obtain, and capital is diverted for extraction, leaving less capital to be invested in </div>
		<div>
The world comes to an abrupt end.
</div>
		<div>By 2030, the population peaks and then declines as the death rate exponentially rises due to lack of food and health services.
</div>
		<div>A few decades into the 21st century, however, economic growth stops abruptly, and begins to reverse.
</div>
		<div>SCENARIO 1</div>
		<div>The world continues to function without any deviation from usual policy or major policy change.
</div>
		<div>The population rises to over 7 billion by 2030.
</div>
		<div>SCENARIO 1
</div>
		<div>SCENARIO 2</div>
		<div>Assuming the world’s revenue of natural resources doubles, and that extraction processes become efficient enough so as to postpone the outset of increasing costs, the industry grows until 2050.</div>
		<div>SCENARIO 2
</div>
		<div>Pollution levels skyrocket, leading to decreased land yields. </div>
		<div>
SCENARIO 1</div>
		<div>Capital is poured into the investment of agricultural recovery.
</div>
		<div>The population sharply declines due to the adversely negative health effects of pollution, as well as food shortages.
</div>
		<div>By 2070, the rising costs of obtaining depleting non-renewable resources, as well as the costs of technological advancements demand more capital than the economy can supply.
</div>
		<div>The world continues to overshoot targets, heading towards global economic and environmental collapse.</div>
		<div>Due to the rising costs of preventing starvation, pollution, resource shortages, the available capital for growth decreases, and industrial output begins to decline by 2040.
</div>
		<div>Human welfare begins to gradually decline throughout the world during the 21st century. By the end of the century, a stable population of approximately 8 billion people live high-tech, low-pollution lifestyles.</div>
		<div>Technology, social services, and new investments become too expensive to maintain. Living standards become unsustainable.
</div>
		<div>This, however, will not eliminate the cause.
</div>
		<div>Examples of such policies could include humanitarian efforts such as providing air conditioners for relief from warming climates, or shipping waste to be disposed in distant regions.</div>
		<div>Policies can include limits to the amount of pollution generated for certain activities, or carbon offsetting.</div>
		<div>Industrial output peaks in 2040, after which it begins to fall. Larger capital investments in industries result in larger waste emissions. This in turn adversely affects the agricultural sector.</div>
		<div>Capital is then diverted to the agricultural sector.
</div>
		<div>By 2050, life expectancy rates decrease due to significant pollution levels.
